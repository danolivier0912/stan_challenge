# Stan coding challenge

### Install

```sh 
git clone git@github.com:danolivier0912/stan_challenge.git stan_challenge
cd stan_challenge
npm install
npm run dev/build
```

#### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
- Better respect the mockup in terms of design
- Dynamize the secondary header title
- Make my app responsive
- Create more components like for example button/link component
- More commits on the repo and not just one

#### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
- 2 separated configs for webpack (dev/build)
- Implement tests
- Setup linter, defaultProps and propTypes
- Make the code less generic, in particular the API code
- Add some user interactions to filter requests instead of filtering it when we receive the response
